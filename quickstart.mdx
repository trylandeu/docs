## 1. Create an Account

Sign up at [platform.tryland.eu](https://platform.tryland.eu) to create your organization and project.

## 2. Get Your API Key

Navigate to the **API Keys** section in your project dashboard and create a new key. Your key will look like `lp_xxx_yyy`.

## 3. Make Your First Request

Fetch the list of available lending markets:

```bash
curl -s https://api2.tryland.eu/markets?chain=solana&protocol=kamino \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer lp_xxx_yyy" | jq .
```

You should see a paginated response with market data including supply/borrow rates, utilization, and risk parameters.

## 4. Install the SDK

For TypeScript/JavaScript projects, install the official SDK:

```bash
npm install @trylandeu/land-sdk
```

Then use it in your code:

```typescript
import { createLandBackendClient } from "@trylandeu/land-sdk";

const land = createLandBackendClient({
  baseUrl: "https://api2.tryland.eu",
  apiKey: "lp_xxx_yyy",
});

const markets = await land.listMarkets({
  chain: "solana",
  protocol: "kamino",
});

console.log(`Found ${markets.total} markets`);
for (const market of markets.items) {
  console.log(`${market.underlying_token.symbol}: ${(market.utilization! * 100).toFixed(1)}% utilization`);
}
```
