## API Keys

All API requests require authentication via a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer lp_xxx_yyy
```

API keys are created in the [dashboard](https://platform.tryland.eu) and follow the format `lp_{project_id}_{secret}`.

## Multi-tenancy Model

Land uses a hierarchical access model:

- **Organization** — your company or team
- **Project** — a logical grouping of API keys (e.g., production, staging)
- **API Key** — credentials scoped to a project

Each API key inherits the permissions and rate limits of its parent project.

## Verifying Your Identity

Use the auth context endpoint to verify your API key and see your tenant identity:

```bash
curl https://api2.tryland.eu/auth/context \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer lp_xxx_yyy"
```

```json
{
  "tenant_id": "org_abc123",
  "caller_id": "key_def456"
}
```

Or with the SDK:

```typescript
const identity = await land.getAuthContext();
console.log(identity.tenant_id); // "org_abc123"
```

## Rate Limits

| Tier | Requests/Day | Requests/Second |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | 10,000 | 1 |

When you exceed your rate limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Contact [founders@tryland.eu](mailto:founders@tryland.eu) for higher limits.

## Security Best Practices

- **Never expose API keys in client-side code.** Use a backend proxy to make API calls.
- **Rotate keys regularly.** Create a new key, update your services, then revoke the old one.
- **Use separate keys for each environment.** Create distinct projects for production and staging.
- **Monitor usage** in the dashboard to detect unusual activity.
