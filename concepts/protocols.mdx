description: Supported lending protocols and cross-protocol normalization
---

Land normalizes data from multiple DeFi lending protocols into a single API. You query the same endpoints regardless of the underlying protocol — the `chain` and `protocol` query parameters let you filter by source.

## Supported Protocols

### Kamino Finance (Solana) — Live

Kamino is a lending protocol on Solana built on top of the Kamino Lend (kLend) smart contracts.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `chain` | `solana` |
| `protocol` | `kamino` |
| Pools | Main Market, Altcoin Market, JLP Market, and more |

All Kamino lending markets are indexed, including supply/borrow positions, interest rates, oracle prices, and on-chain events.

### Aave v3 (EVM) — Coming Soon

Aave v3 is the leading lending protocol across EVM chains including Ethereum, Base, and Arbitrum.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `chain` | `evm` |
| `protocol` | `aave-v3` |
| Chains | Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum |

## Cross-Protocol Normalization

The same data model applies regardless of protocol:

- **Obligations** map to Kamino obligations or Aave user positions
- **Positions** map to individual supply/borrow entries
- **Markets** map to Kamino reserves or Aave reserve configurations
- **Health factor** and **LTV** are computed consistently across protocols

## Filtering by Protocol

All list endpoints support `chain` and `protocol` query parameters:

```typescript
// Kamino markets only
const kaminoMarkets = await land.listMarkets({
  chain: "solana",
  protocol: "kamino",
});

// All markets (when multiple protocols are live)
const allMarkets = await land.listMarkets();
```

```bash
# Filter by chain and protocol
curl "https://api2.tryland.eu/markets?chain=solana&protocol=kamino" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer lp_xxx_yyy"
```
