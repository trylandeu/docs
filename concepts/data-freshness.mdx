<Snippet file="freshness-note.mdx" />

## Freshness Guarantees

Every response from the Land API includes timestamps that tell you exactly how fresh the data is.

### The `as_of` Field

Every data object includes an `as_of` timestamp indicating when the data was last computed or synced from the underlying protocol. Use this field to determine the age of any piece of data.

```json
{
  "price_usd": 150.25,
  "as_of": "2026-02-22T12:00:05Z",
  "staleness_seconds": 12
}
```

### Staleness Detection

Price responses include a `staleness_seconds` field — the number of seconds since the price was last updated on-chain. This helps you distinguish between a fresh price and one that hasn't been updated by the oracle in a while.

## Fail-Closed Behavior

Land follows a fail-closed approach to stale data. Instead of returning potentially outdated values, the API returns a **503 Service Unavailable** error when data is too stale to be reliable.

```json
{
  "code": "STATE_TOO_OLD",
  "message": "Indexer data is too stale to serve a reliable response"
}
```

Related error codes:

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `INDEXER_LAGGING` | The indexer is behind and data may not reflect the latest on-chain state |
| `PRICE_TOO_OLD` | Oracle price data is too stale to be reliable |
| `STATE_TOO_OLD` | General staleness — the indexed state is too far behind |

## Coverage Metadata

Wallet-scoped responses include a `coverage` object that describes what data range is available:

```json
{
  "coverage": {
    "coverage_mode": "forward_only",
    "coverage_start_slot": 280000000,
    "coverage_start_block": null,
    "wallet_tracking_status": "tracked",
    "first_tracked_at": "2026-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `coverage_mode` | `full` (complete history) or `forward_only` (data from first tracking onward) |
| `coverage_start_slot` | Solana slot number from which data is available |
| `coverage_start_block` | EVM block number from which data is available |
| `wallet_tracking_status` | `not_tracked_yet`, `seeded`, or `tracked` |
| `first_tracked_at` | Timestamp when tracking began for this wallet |

### Wallet Tracking Status

When you first query a wallet, it goes through a tracking lifecycle:

1. **`not_tracked_yet`** — The wallet has never been queried. Land begins indexing.
2. **`seeded`** — Initial data load is in progress. Partial data may be available.
3. **`tracked`** — The wallet is fully indexed and data is up to date.
